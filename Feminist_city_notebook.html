<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 1: City of Moms</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Flâneuse &gt; Page 30 &middot; Location 439</div><div class='noteText'>For those who reject the idea , women can never fully escape into invisibility because their gender marks them as objects of the male gaze .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Flâneuse &gt; Page 30 &middot; Location 453</div><div class='noteText'>Elkin insists the reluctance of men like Baudelaire , Benjamin , and Simmel to imagine a female flâneur comes from their inability to notice women acting in ways that didn’t fit their preconceived notions .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - A Woman’s Place &gt; Page 34 &middot; Location 517</div><div class='noteText'>As I tried to navigate an unfamiliar set of everyday routines as a new mom , the city was a physical force I had to constantly struggle against . Wasn’t the city supposed to be the place where women could best juggle the demands of their double and triple days of social reproduction , paid work , school , and myriad other roles ? Didn’t my PhD supervisor proclaim that a “ woman’s place is in the city ” ? 41 If that was true , why did every day feel like a fight against an enemy that was invisible yet all around me ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - A Woman’s Place &gt; Page 36 &middot; Location 557</div><div class='noteText'>By providing a spatial solution to the temporary widening of women’s horizons , the public - private , paid - unpaid work divide could be “ naturally ” re - established between the sexes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - A Woman’s Place &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 560</div><div class='noteText'>Large houses , isolated from transit and other services , meant the stay - at - home wife and mother was required to perform a full - time domestic caretaker role , overseeing the home and managing the needs of the breadwinner and children . As feminist planner Sherilyn MacGregor states , this built form has “ created a lasting infrastructure for the [ gendered ] division of labour , ” one that pre - supposes the traditional heterosexual nuclear family . 46</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - A Woman’s Place &gt; Page 37 &middot; Location 571</div><div class='noteText'>The isolation , size of the family home , need for multiple vehicles , and demands of child care can continue to push women either out of the workplace or into lower - paying , part - time jobs that mostly allow them to juggle the responsibilities of suburban life . It’s rarely the male breadwinner’s career that is sacrificed or downsized . After all , given the long - standing gender pay gap , it makes no sense to limit the man’s earning potential .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The City Fix &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 579</div><div class='noteText'>Research in the 1970s and 1980s found women use the city more intensively than men , are “ more involved in work , neighbourhood and cultural activities than suburban women and most of these opportunities are lost when they move to the suburbs . ” 48</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The City Fix &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 582</div><div class='noteText'>critic Jane Jacobs challenged the prevailing idea that the suburbs were good places for women and children . She noted isolation , a lack of people on the streets , and car dependency as concerns that particularly affected women while also contributing to the decline of the public realm in general . 49</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The City Fix &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 587</div><div class='noteText'>Geographer Kim England writes that gender roles are “ fossilized into the concrete appearance of space . Hence the location of residential areas , work - places , transportation networks , and the overall layout of cities in general reflect a patriarchal capitalist society’s expectations of what types of activities take place where , when and by whom . ” 50</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The City Fix &gt; Page 38 &middot; Location 592</div><div class='noteText'>This has meant that even though cities have a lot of advantages relative to the suburbs , they’re certainly not built with the aim of making women’s “ double shifts ” of paid and unpaid work easier to manage .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The City Fix &gt; Page 40 &middot; Location 623</div><div class='noteText'>“ What would cities look like if they were designed by mothers ? ” 55</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Gentrifying Motherhood &gt; Page 41 &middot; Location 643</div><div class='noteText'>Gentrification is basically the process whereby working class , lower income neighbourhoods get taken over by middle - class households and businesses . There are a lot of causes and forms of gentrification , but my neighbourhood — the Junction — was experiencing a kind of start - stop slow motion transition when I first moved there in early 2000 .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Gentrifying Motherhood &gt; Page 45 &middot; Location 712</div><div class='noteText'>My own enrichment — completing higher education — relied in part on the availability of the underpaid labour of others ( delivery people , child care workers ) ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Gentrifying Motherhood &gt; Page 47 &middot; Location 738</div><div class='noteText'>The traditional nuclear family is no longer the norm . Cities are full of blended families , complex kinship relations entailed by divorce and remarriage , lone parents , queer relationships , polyamorous families , foster families , migration of family members , non - family households , multi - generation households , empty nesters , and more . But you wouldn’t know it by looking at the way our cities and their suburbs are designed to function . Ideally , all of these diverse kinship networks could open up possibilities for sharing the work of social reproduction , care - giving , and child - raising in creative , even feminist , ways .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Gentrifying Motherhood &gt; Page 47 &middot; Location 747</div><div class='noteText'>Gentrification pushes out single parents , low - income people , and affordable services , scattering kin across the city .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 48 &middot; Location 761</div><div class='noteText'>When I started my master’s degree with a child under one year of age and no way to afford day care ( wait lists for subsidized spots were outrageous ) , I scrambled to find time to complete my work . Luckily , I met Anneke . We had classes together and discovered that we were both the primary caregivers for very young kids . I started bringing Maddy to Anneke’s house two days a week and we took turns watching the kids while one of us left for a few hours to study . The little bit of extra time afforded by what I liked to call the “ city’s smallest babysitting co - op ” made a huge difference .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 49 &middot; Location 769</div><div class='noteText'>Under neoliberalism , most of the “ solutions ” generated for those problems have been market - based , meaning they require the ability to pay for extra services , conveniences , and someone else’s underpaid labour .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 49 &middot; Location 772</div><div class='noteText'>In Europe , “ gender - mainstreaming ” approaches to urban planning and budgetary decisions have a longer history . Essentially , these frameworks mean that every planning , policy , and budget decision has to be considered with the goal of gender equality as the departure point . For example , policymakers must ask how a decision will potentially enhance or undermine gender equality . These approaches push cities to consider how decisions support or stymie the care work that literally keeps society functioning .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 50 &middot; Location 799</div><div class='noteText'>The vice mayor of Stockholm , Daniel Helldén , described the plan to Canadian media , arguing that instead of plowing in ways that reinforce car - centred behavior , Stockholm’s method encourages everyone to use alternative modes of transportation . Instead of replicating the status quo , their plan looks forward to “ how you want your city to be . ” 77</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 51 &middot; Location 816</div><div class='noteText'>Geographer Brenda Parker writes compellingly about the experiences of low - income African American women in Milwaukee . 80 Parker argues that gentrification and cutbacks to urban social services result in “ amplification ” and “ intensification ” effects on the everyday lives and labours of these women , effects that get written on the body in the form of exhaustion , illness , and chronic pain .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 52 &middot; Location 827</div><div class='noteText'>Low - income racialized women are more vulnerable to displacement , getting pushed into under - serviced areas where the benefits of urban living — interconnected access to places of employment , schools , services , retail , transit , and home life — are decidedly thinned out .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 53 &middot; Location 847</div><div class='noteText'>Black feminist writers like bell hooks and Patricia Hill Collins , who contend that Black women’s social reproductive work has mostly been subject to punitive measures by the state , such as having children taken away or being subject to “ workfare ” policies . 86 Feminist activism around domestic labour has typically centred the white , heterosexual married woman and ignored the particular needs and concerns of women of colour .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 54 &middot; Location 857</div><div class='noteText'>Homeplaces are political spaces that black women create to express care for each other and their communities , and to remember , revise , and revive scripts of black political resistance . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 54 &middot; Location 859</div><div class='noteText'>An urban politics of care is enacted not only through an attachment to place , but as “ an active and collective working toward physical , symbolic , and relational transformations . ” 90</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 54 &middot; Location 862</div><div class='noteText'>And let’s face it , relying heavily on the state for radical transformation is a waste of time , and perhaps even dangerous for Black and Indigenous people and people of colour who have been deemed expendable or positioned as “ problems ” to be solved or disposed of in the “ progressive ” city . Isoke’s study illustrates the power of forging alliances across diverse communities to combat racism , sexism , and homophobia to “ confront and transform [ the ] structural intersectionality ” of oppressions in the city . 91 I want cities to enact policies and create spaces that make care work and social reproduction more collective , less exhausting , and more equitable .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 55 &middot; Location 876</div><div class='noteText'>It’s clear that the time has come to decentre the heterosexual , nuclear family in everything from housing design to transportation strategies , neighbourhood planning to urban zoning . This means that city planners and architects can’t take the white , able - bodied cis man as the default subject and imagine everyone else as a variation on the norm . Instead , the margins must become the centre .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - The Non-Sexist City &gt; Page 55 &middot; Location 883</div><div class='noteText'>A feminist city must be one where barriers — physical and social — are dismantled , where all bodies are welcome and accommodated . A feminist city must be care - centred , not because women should remain largely responsible for care work , but because the city has the potential to spread care work more evenly . A feminist city must look to the creative tools that women have always used to support one another and find ways to build that support into the very fabric of the urban world .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Chapter 2: City of Friends</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 899</div><div class='noteText'>The power of female friendship is typically either underestimated , undermined , or ignored all together in cultural narratives . There are few examples that speak to the importance of women’s friendships in relation to life in the city .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 902</div><div class='noteText'>For far more ordinary women , friendships are also part of our urban survival toolkits .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friendship as a Way of Life &gt; Page 57 &middot; Location 906</div><div class='noteText'>“ What would female friendship as a way of life look like ? ” 92 Work highlighting the complexity of female friendship is much rarer than movies , television shows , and books that gloss over women’s friendships to focus instead on romantic relationships , family lives , and dramatic life events .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Girls Town &gt; Page 63 &middot; Location 1011</div><div class='noteText'>They must develop their own strategies for avoiding adult surveillance and gaining permission to explore , including using the power of friendship to assuage parental fears about girls alone . Girls can even work together to make direct claims on the city . For example , girls in Hanoi formed a collective to create ‘ zines to educate bus drivers and passengers about girls ’ safety from harassment on public transit . In Kampala , a youth collective fought to improve hygiene in the city as well as more walkable infrastructure to make sure girls could continue to go to school or work . 104</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friendships and Freedom &gt; Page 72 &middot; Location 1172</div><div class='noteText'>Erin Wunker suggests that prioritizing female friendship , even writing about it or representing it on the screen , is an act of insurgency that starts to unmake the tightly woven cloth of heter - onormativity , capitalism , reproductive labour , and domesticity . 118</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friendships and Freedom &gt; Page 72 &middot; Location 1177</div><div class='noteText'>Women make friends in the suburbs , sure . But the design of the suburban landscape encourages a private , inward focus .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friendships and Freedom &gt; Page 73 &middot; Location 1180</div><div class='noteText'>the suburban woman may have few opportunities or needs to make new friends or keep up with old ones .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Queer Women’s Spaces &gt; Page 73 &middot; Location 1192</div><div class='noteText'>Historically , lesbians have struggled to find space in cities , as gay neighbourhoods typically focused on the interests and lifestyles of young gay men .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 76 &middot; Location 1247</div><div class='noteText'>Women’s friendships are starting to be recognized for providing things that romantic partnership ( especially with men ) might not , such as a shared set of experiences and even a strong feminist foundation . And cities are providing the environments where women can make and sustain these connections , perhaps even over the course of a lifetime .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 77 &middot; Location 1269</div><div class='noteText'>how could we create or repurpose spaces , especially urban spaces , in ways that open up a wide range of possibilities for sustaining and practicing the kinds of relationships that we think will support us across the life course ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 78 &middot; Location 1270</div><div class='noteText'>It’s a challenging question with a lot of roadblocks in the way of an answer . Friendship , such a central preoccupation of childhood and adolescence , isn’t taken as seriously in adulthood , and of course it exists in an informal and unstructured context . Unlike marriage , it’s not recognized by the state and there are no formal or legal bonds of friendship . This is probably as it should be , but even without a “ friendship license , ” adult friendships could be considered among the relationships and values important to the imagining of urban places .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 78 &middot; Location 1284</div><div class='noteText'>Feminist urbanists claim that there’s an “ entrenched old guard wedded to old paradigms , uninterested in testing or exploring new ones ” unless they involve fancy algorithms and big data . 132</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 79 &middot; Location 1292</div><div class='noteText'>Certainly we could make an economic argument around women’s friendships . As Traister observes , women socializing together fill restaurants , bars , shops , and cafés from brunch until closing . She recalls moving to New York and watching women take up space together : “ They — we actually — were sucking up every bit of energy from this city’s sidewalks , populating its streets and its theatres and its office buildings and apartments , giving this city its character and its rhythm and its beauty and its speed . ” 133</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 79 &middot; Location 1299</div><div class='noteText'>It’s still a long way from a city set up to nurture , enhance , and even rely on women’s friendship networks as an integral and deeply necessary part of everyday life .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 80 &middot; Location 1310</div><div class='noteText'>don’t think we can rely on urban policy and planning to sustain or generate the kinds of spaces that allow non - traditional relationships to flourish . Planning paradigms and property regimes that favour particular kinds of ownership are slow to change .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 80 &middot; Location 1312</div><div class='noteText'>Furthermore , in most cities , the private real estate market determines what kinds of spaces are built , which businesses survive , and even which services will be provided .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 81 &middot; Location 1322</div><div class='noteText'>We should never underestimate the power — and the threat — of challenging the centrality of the nuclear family , culturally , legally , and spatially .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 81 &middot; Location 1324</div><div class='noteText'>Wunker insists that a focus on friendship has revolutionary potential . It defies patriarchal logics : “ There are bodies with other bodies — laughing , crying , cooking , dancing , hugging — with no imperative to procreation or other reproductive labours . Friendship as counter to capitalist ideology . Friendship as its own economy . ” 135</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 81 &middot; Location 1333</div><div class='noteText'>Perhaps imagining the city centred on friendship seems impossible simply because of this : if women dedicated even a little bit more of their love , labour , and emotional support to their friend networks , the system — as men know it — would come crashing down . It’s a radical prospect to consider , and one that profoundly decentres both the family and the state . TallBear insists :</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Friends ’til the End &gt; Page 82 &middot; Location 1340</div><div class='noteText'>If women , Indigenous people , people of colour , queer , and trans folks insist on valuing and re - centring relations that have been systematically undermined , the status quo inevitably tilts in ways that are frightening and fantastic . This is a huge step toward the feminist city , the city that values women’s relationships , decentres the nuclear family , and lets women and girls take up space and make relations on their own terms .</h3>
